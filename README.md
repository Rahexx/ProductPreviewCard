## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- BEM

### What I learned

I learn using rem for font-size. I was always stubborn about this but it is better use rem.

### Continued development

In the next project I will use LESS instead SCSS, so I can use both of them in the future projects.
