## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- BEM
- Github Actions

### What I learned

I am learning to use rem for font sizes. I was always stubborn about this, but it is better to use rem.
I used GitHub Actions for the first time to install Sass, which allowed me to delete the CSS folder.
Now I install Sass on the server, compile the Sass files to CSS, and then the server runs the deployment for GitHub Pages.
I will be using this setup every time, especially when I start using JavaScript and testing.

### Continued development

In the next project I will use LESS instead SCSS, so I can use both of them in the future projects.
